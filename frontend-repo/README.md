# Next.js Firebase Authentication App

This project is a Next.js application integrated with Firebase for authentication. It uses Redux for state management and MUI for the UI components.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to have a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables configured. This file is used to securely store your Firebase configuration and other sensitive information.

### Setting Up the `.env` File

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project if it does not already exist.

2. **Add the following environment variables** to your `.env` file:

    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id

    # Other Environment Variables (if applicable)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your-api-url
    ```

   Replace `your-firebase-*` placeholders with your actual Firebase configuration values.

3. **Ensure `.env` is included in your `.gitignore`** to avoid committing sensitive information to version control:

    ```gitignore
    .env
    ```

### Running the Application

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Additional Setup

- **Firebase Setup**: Ensure that your Firebase project is properly set up and that you've configured authentication methods in the Firebase Console.
- **Redux Setup**: The application uses Redux for state management. Make sure to configure and use Redux according to your project needs.

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues related to environment variables, double-check that the `.env` file is correctly configured and placed in the root directory.
- Ensure that all Firebase configuration values are correct and up-to-date.
